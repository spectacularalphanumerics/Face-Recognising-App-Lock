# Face-Recognizing App Lock

A Python-based security tool that uses facial recognition to restrict access to specific applications. Unauthorized users are logged, and the application is shut down.

## Overview
Face-Recognizing App Lock is a Python project designed to enhance system security by restricting access to specific applications based on facial recognition. 

This project is a proof of concept and may require adjustments to work on different systems. It is intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for more advanced implementations.
